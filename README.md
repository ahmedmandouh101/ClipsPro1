**Project Description: Disease Diagnosis Using Question-based Expert System**

# Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent expert system for disease diagnosis using a question-based approach. The system utilizes the CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) framework to create a rule-based inference engine that guides users through a series of questions to determine the likelihood of specific diseases. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and expert knowledge, this project aims to provide accurate and efficient disease diagnosis support.

# Features
Question-based Approach: The system employs a user-friendly interface that prompts users with relevant questions related to their symptoms and medical history. Based on the user's responses, the system applies a set of predefined rules to narrow down the list of potential diseases.

Rule-based Inference Engine: Using the CLIPS framework, the system utilizes a rule-based inference engine to match the user's input against a knowledge base of symptoms, diseases, and associated rules. These rules are designed to mimic the diagnostic process followed by medical professionals.

Efficient Diagnosis: By asking targeted questions and employing logical reasoning, the system can efficiently identify potential diseases. It reduces the need for exhaustive manual search and provides users with a list of probable diseases, ranked by their likelihood based on the provided information.

Extensibility: The project is built with extensibility in mind, allowing the addition of new diseases, symptoms, and rules to the knowledge base. This flexibility ensures that the system can adapt to new medical discoveries and updates.
